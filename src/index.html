			<p>
				The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, <br>
				each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). <br>
				Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are <br>
				horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:<br>
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<i>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.</i>
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</i>
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</i>
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</i>
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>These rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the
						following:</i>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<i>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.</i>
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.</i>
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.</i>
			</ol>

			<p>
				The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the
				above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed; births and deaths occur simultaneously,
				and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick.
				Each generation is a pure function of the preceding one.
				The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.

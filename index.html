<h2><i>Rules</i></h2>
The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, <br>
each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). <br>
Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are <br>
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:<br>

<ol><i>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.</i></ol>
<ol><i>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</i></ol>
<ol><i>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</i></ol>
<ol><i>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</i></ol>
<ol><i>These rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:</i></ol>
<br>
<ol><i>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.</i></ol>
<ol><i>Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.</i></ol>
<ol><i>All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.</i></ol>

The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the <br>
above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed; births and deaths occur simultaneously, <br>
and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick. <br>
Each generation is a pure function of the preceding one. <br>
The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.<br>
